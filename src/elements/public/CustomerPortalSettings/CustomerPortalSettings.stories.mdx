# Customer Portal Settings

[![hAPI](https://img.shields.io/badge/hAPI-customer__portal__settings-green.svg)](https://api.foxycart.com/rels/customer_portal_settings)

The `<foxy-customer-portal-settings>` element is a **relation element** that provides a visual interface for
interacting with the `customer_portal_settings` hAPI relation.

## Setup

All relation elements need an `href` attribute to know where to load their content from and a
request handler to connect to the backend. You can check if your component is configured properly by
running your project and looking for the error message like below â€“ if it isn't there, then you're
good to go.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default" height="320px">
    {() => html`<foxy-customer-portal-settings></foxy-customer-portal-settings>`}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

You can learn more about how request handlers work in `<foxy-admin>` docs. The href attribute is a full path to the customer portal settings
resource to load into the component. If you're working with our hAPI, setting up this element is as easy as wrapping it into `<foxy-api>`
and setting the `href` attribute on the node:

```html
<foxy-api endpoint="https://foxy-demo.foxycart.com/s/admin">
  <foxy-customer-portal-settings
    href="https://foxy-demo.foxycart.com/s/admin/stores/8/customer_portal_settings"
  >
  </foxy-customer-portal-settings>
</foxy-api>
```

A properly configured element should look like this:

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Configured" height="320px">
    {() => html`
      <div class="container mx-auto p-2 sm:p-4 md:p-6 lg:p-8">
        <foxy-customer-portal-settings
          href="https://api.foxy.test/stores/8/customer_portal_settings"
          @request=${handleRequest}
        >
        </foxy-customer-portal-settings>
      </div>
    `}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Customize

Just like every other element in this package, `<foxy-customer-portal-settings>` is powered by an amazing Vaadin Lumo
theme that comes with a ton of customizable CSS Custom Properties. For more details and examples please
refer to the `<foxy-admin>` docs.

## Localize

Our admin will try to detect and use the most suitable language for the user agent, but you can always
override the automatic detection by setting the `lang` attribute/property. For more details and examples please
refer to the `<foxy-admin>` docs.
