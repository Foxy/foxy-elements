# CustomerApi

<Subtitle>Element connector for Customer API</Subtitle>

Our Elements are designed to work with a variety of backends â€“ whether provided by Foxy or maintained by a 3rd party. To make that possible, we rely on DOM events to make API requests: before each call, our elements dispatch a `fetch` event and wait for it to be handled before proceeding with the default behaviour. This is where the connectors come in. They intercept `fetch` events, inject auth info and even rewrite requests (if necessary) for a specific backend.

## Getting started

This particular connector makes child Elements compatible with the Customer API powering our Customer Portal and usually available at `https://your.store.domain/s/customer`. To get started, simply wrap your setup into `foxy-customer-api` and specify base URL:

```html
<foxy-customer-api base="https://your.store.domain/s/customer/" storage="local">
  <h2>Billing</h2>
  <foxy-address-card href="https://your.store.domain/s/customer/default_billing_address">
  </foxy-address-card>

  <h2>Transactions</h2>
  <foxy-transactions-table href="https://your.store.domain/s/customer/transactions">
  </foxy-transactions-table>
</foxy-customer-api>
```

## Storage

You can choose between multiple types of storage for the session info: `memory` for in-memory storage (clears on reload), `session` for Session Storage (clears when browser restarts) and `local` for Local Storage (clears when a customer logs out; clears after 7 days in Safari). You can also get more extensive logging by increasing `level` (up to 5).

## Virtual endpoints

This element supports multiple virtual endpoints. Requests to those endpoints will be automatically rewritten to match their Customer API counterparts:

### `foxy://customer-api/session`

`POST` with the following payload will call `POST /s/customer/authenticate` and respond with status `200` (on successful sign-in), `401` (when email or password doesn't match) or `500` (if something breaks) and a `null` body.

```ts
type AuthSessionPostPayload = {
  type: 'password';
  credential: { email: string; password: string };
};
```

`DELETE` will call `DELETE /s/customer/authenticate` and respond with status `200` (on successful sign-out) or `500` (if something breaks) and a `null` body.

### `foxy://customer-api/recover`

`POST` with the following payload will call `POST /s/customer/forgot_password` and respond with status `200` (if password reset request was acknowledged) or `500` (if something breaks) and a `null` body.

```ts
type AuthRecoverPostPayload = {
  type: 'email';
  detail: { email: string };
};
```
