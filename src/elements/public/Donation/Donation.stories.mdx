# Donation

Donation form is a web component that aims to provide customizable donation forms.

## Minimal setup

The first thing you'll need to do is add the JavaScript call and basic donation component to your page:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@foxy.io/elements/dist/cdn/foxy-donation.js"></script>
<foxy-donation 
  currency="usd"
  amount="25" 
  store="your-store-domain" 
  name="One-Time Donation" 
>
</foxy-donation>
```

Below is a description the elements that are required for the respective attributes for the minimal setup (already supplied in the example above):

| Property / Attribute | Description             | Example                    |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `currency`           | 3-letter currency code. | `usd`                      |
| `amount`             | Donation amount.        | `25`                       |
| `store`              | Your store subdomain.   | `jamstackecommerceexample` |
| `name`               | Cart item name.         | `One-Time Donation`        |

If the component is misconfigured it will display an error message like the one below. If you see this, you'll want to review the code supplied above:

<Canvas mdxSource="<foxy-donation></foxy-donation>">
  <Story name="Default">{html`<foxy-donation></foxy-donation>`}</Story>
</Canvas>

Once you've set up the component, you'll see the most basic version of this element ― a one-click donation button that you can put anywhere on your page:

<Canvas
  mdxSource={dedent`
    <foxy-donation
      currency="usd"
      amount="25"
      store="jamstackecommerceexample"
      name="One-Time Donation"
    >
    </foxy-donation>
  `}
>
  <Story name="Minimal">{args => html`${getTemplate(args)}`}</Story>
</Canvas>

## Customizing amount

If you'd like your visitors to be able to pick a donation amount from a list of predefined values, you can specify them via the `amounts` attribute using JSON like so: `.amounts=${args.amounts}`. The order of items will be respected.

<Canvas
  mdxSource={dedent`
    <foxy-donation 
      currency="usd" 
      amounts="[25, 50, 75]"
      amount="25" 
      store="jamstackecommerceexample" 
      name="One-Time Donation" 
    >
    </foxy-donation>
  `}
>
  <Story name="Amount options" args={{ amounts: [25, 50, 75] }}>
    {args => html`${getTemplate(args)}`}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

Quite often it's suitable to ask users for a donation amount outside of the list of predefined values. You can enable this option by setting the `custom` attribute on our donation form element: `custom='["amount"]'`. Please note that you'll need at least one amount option in the `amounts` array for this option to work.

<Canvas
  mdxSource={dedent`
    <foxy-donation
      currency="usd"
      amounts="[25, 50, 75]"
      amount="25"
      custom='["amount"]'
      store="jamstackecommerceexample"
      name="One-Time Donation"
    >
    </foxy-donation>
  `}
>
  <Story name="Custom amount" args={{ amounts: [25, 50, 75], custom: ['amount'] }}>
    {args => html`${getTemplate(args)}`}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Adding designations

Sometimes you might want to ask your donors to pick a cause to contribute to, which can be particularly useful if your organization has multiple donation-sponsored programs. To display a designation picker, provide the list of choices in the `designations` attribute value in form of a JSON array like this: `designations=["Medical Care", "Daily Meals", "Housing"]`. You can also pre-select a specific designation by setting the `designation` attribute: `designation="Daily Meals"`.

You can aggregate multiple designation under categories, for example: `designations='["Medical Care", ["Nutrition", ["Daily Meals", "Infant Nutrition Aid", "Elderly Nutrition Suplement"]], "Housing"]'`.

If an aggregated designation is to be the default choice, set the `designation` attribute as `ParentDesignation: ChildDesignation`. Here is an example to set `Daily Meals` as the default in the list used above example: `designation: "Nutrition: Daily Meals"`.


<Canvas
  mdxSource={dedent`
    <foxy-donation
      designations='["Medical Care", ["Nutrition", ["Daily Meals", "Infant Nutrition Aid", "Elderly Nutrition Suplement"]], "Housing"]'
      designation="Nutrition: Daily Meals"
      currency="usd"
      amounts="[25, 50, 75]"
      amount="25"
      custom='["amount"]'
      store="jamstackecommerceexample"
      name="One-Time Donation"
    >
    </foxy-donation>
  `}
>
  <Story
    name="Designation options"
    args={{
      designations: ['Medical Care', ['Nutrition', ['Daily Meals', 'Infant Nutrition Aid', 'Elderly Nutrition Suplement']], 'Housing'],
      designation: 'Nutrition: Daily Meals',
      amounts: [25, 50, 75],
      custom: ['amount'],
    }}
  >
    {args => html`${getTemplate(args)}`}
  </Story>
</Canvas>


Just like with the amount, you can enable custom designations by adding "designation" to the `custom` attribute array: `custom='["amount", "designation"]'`. This works both in single and multiple selection modes.

<Canvas
  mdxSource={dedent`
    <foxy-donation
      designations='["Medical Care", "Daily Meals", "Housing"]'
      designation='Housing'
      currency="usd"
      amounts="[25, 50, 75]"
      amount="25"
      custom='["amount", "designation"]'
      store="jamstackecommerceexample"
      name="One-Time Donation"
    >
    </foxy-donation>
  `}
>
  <Story
    name="Custom designation"
    args={{
      designations: ['Medical Care', 'Daily Meals', 'Housing'],
      designation: 'Housing',
      amounts: [25, 50, 75],
      custom: ['amount', 'designation'],
    }}
  >
    {args => html`${getTemplate(args)}`}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Enabling recurrent donations

You can easily allow your website visitors to commit to a recurrent contribution by providing a recurrence pattern in the `frequency` attribute. Recurrent patterns consist of an integer (1, 2, 3...) and a unit (`d`, for days, `w` for weeks, `m` for months, `y` for years), e.g. `2w` translates to a bi-weekly donation and `1y` – to a yearly one. There's also a special value of `.5m` that creates a recurring payment running twice a month. Let's default to a monthly donation in the following example: `frequency="1m"`.

<Canvas
  mdxSource={dedent`
    <foxy-donation
      designations='["Medical Care", "Daily Meals", "Housing"]'
      designation="Housing",
      currency="usd"
      amounts="[25, 50, 75]"
      amount="25"
      custom='["amount", "designation"]'
      store="jamstackecommerceexample"
      name="Monthly Donation"
      frequency="1m"
    >
    </foxy-donation>
  `}
>
  <Story
    name="Recurrent donation"
    args={{
      designations: ['Medical Care', 'Daily Meals', 'Housing'],
      designation: "Housing",
      frequency: '1m',
      amounts: [25, 50, 75],
      custom: ['amount', 'designation'],
    }}
  >
    {args => html`${getTemplate(args)}`}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

If you feel like providing no recurrence options is a bit restrictive, you can use the `frequencies` attribute to give your donors more choice. Let's add twice a month, every month and every year as options in addition to a one-time payment: `frequencies='[" ", ".5m", "1m", "1y"]'`. Note how we've used a JSON array here – just like in `amounts`.

<Canvas
  mdxSource={dedent`
    <foxy-donation
      designations='["Medical Care", "Daily Meals", "Housing"]'
      designation='Housing'
      frequencies='[" ", ".5m", "1m", "1y"]'
      frequency="1m"
      currency="usd"
      amounts="[25, 50, 75]"
      amount="25"
      custom='["amount", "designation"]'
      store="jamstackecommerceexample"
      name="One-Time Donation"
    >
    </foxy-donation>
  `}
>
  <Story
    name="Recurrence options"
    args={{
      designations: ['Medical Care', 'Daily Meals', 'Housing'],
      designation: 'Housing',
      frequencies: [' ', '.5m', '1m', '1y'],
      frequency: '1m',
      amounts: [25, 50, 75],
      custom: ['amount', 'designation'],
    }}
  >
    {args => html`${getTemplate(args)}`}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Comment

If you'd like your donors to be able to leave a short message (visible only to you), you can set the `comment` attribute on the element to display a text field at the bottom. You can also pre-populate it with a custom text by assigning a value to the same attribute.

<Canvas
  mdxSource={dedent`
    <foxy-donation
      designations='["Medical Care", "Daily Meals", "Housing"]'
      designation="Daily Meals"
      frequencies='[" ", ".5m", "1m", "1y"]'
      frequency="1m"
      currency="usd"
      amounts="[25, 50, 75]"
      amount="25"
      custom='["amount", "designation"]'
      store="jamstackecommerceexample"
      name="One-Time Donation"
      comment
    >
    </foxy-donation>
  `}
>
  <Story
    name="Comment"
    args={{
      designations: ['Medical Care', 'Daily Meals', 'Housing'],
      designation: 'Daily Meals',
      frequencies: [' ', '.5m', '1m', '1y'],
      frequency: '1m',
      amounts: [25, 50, 75],
      comment: '',
      custom: ['amount', 'designation'],
    }}
  >
    {args => html`${getTemplate(args)}`}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Anonymity

Giving your donors an option to remain anonymous is often a reasonable idea. While we can't hide the customer info from the transactions, we can let you know that they've requested to keep their identity off the records. To enable this option, set the `anonymity` attribute on an element (no value required – it's a boolean attribute).

<Canvas
  mdxSource={dedent`
    <foxy-donation
      designations='["Medical Care", "Daily Meals", "Housing"]'
      designation="Housing"
      frequencies='[" ", ".5m", "1m", "1y"]'
      frequency="1m"
      currency="usd"
      amounts="[25, 50, 75]"
      amount="25"
      custom='["amount", "designation"]'
      store="jamstackecommerceexample"
      name="One-Time Donation"
      anonymity
      comment
    >
    </foxy-donation>
  `}
>
  <Story
    name="Anonymity"
    args={{
      designations: ['Medical Care', 'Daily Meals', 'Housing'],
      designation: "Housing",
      frequencies: [' ', '.5m', '1m', '1y'],
      frequency: '1m',
      anonymity: true,
      amounts: [25, 50, 75],
      comment: '',
      custom: ['amount', 'designation'],
    }}
  >
    {args => html`${getTemplate(args)}`}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

You can also enable anonymous donations by default by setting the `anonymous` attribute:

<Canvas
  mdxSource={dedent`
    <foxy-donation
      designations='["Medical Care", "Daily Meals", "Housing"]'
      designation="Housing"
      frequencies='[" ", ".5m", "1m", "1y"]'
      frequency="1m"
      currency="usd"
      amounts="[25, 50, 75]"
      amount="25"
      custom='["amount", "designation"]'
      store="jamstackecommerceexample"
      name="One-Time Donation"
      anonymity
      anonymous
      comment
    >
    </foxy-donation>
  `}
>
  <Story
    name="Anonymous by default"
    args={{
      designations: ['Medical Care', 'Daily Meals', 'Housing'],
      designation: "Housing",
      frequencies: [' ', '.5m', '1m', '1y'],
      frequency: '1m',
      anonymity: true,
      anonymous: true,
      amounts: [25, 50, 75],
      comment: '',
      custom: ['amount', 'designation'],
    }}
  >
    {args => html`${getTemplate(args)}`}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Customizing the cart display

You can use the `name`, `image` and `url` attributes to customize how the donation will be shown in the cart. Only `name` is required – all other attributes are optional. None of these options will affect the form appearance and will be shown during the checkout instead.

<Canvas
  mdxSource={dedent`
    <foxy-donation
      designations='["Medical Care", "Daily Meals", "Housing"]'
      designation="Housing"
      frequencies='[" ", ".5m", "1m", "1y"]'
      frequency="1m"
      currency="usd"
      amounts="[25, 50, 75]"
      amount="25"
      custom='["amount", "designation"]'
      store="jamstackecommerceexample"
      image="https://picsum.photos/320"
      name="One-Time Donation"
      url="https://foxy.io"
      anonymity
      anonymous
      comment
    >
    </foxy-donation>
  `}
>
  <Story
    name="Cart display"
    args={{
      designations: ['Medical Care', 'Daily Meals', 'Housing'],
      designation: "Housing",
      frequencies: [' ', '.5m', '1m', '1y'],
      frequency: '1m',
      anonymity: true,
      anonymous: true,
      amounts: [25, 50, 75],
      comment: '',
      custom: ['amount', 'designation'],
      image: 'https://picsum.photos/320',
      url: 'https://foxy.io',
    }}
  >
    {args => html`${getTemplate(args)}`}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Add your own markup

You can insert your own content in a number of pre-defined places called slots.  This element has 3 of them: `amount`, `designation` and `comment`, and you can assign any element node to any of them by setting an attribute on it like so: `slot="comment"`. Please note that your content will be displayed only if the relevant group is present on the screen. You can see the position of each one of them below:

<Canvas
  mdxSource={dedent`
    <foxy-donation
      designations='["Medical Care", "Daily Meals", "Housing"]'
      designation="Housing"
      frequencies='[" ", ".5m", "1m", "1y"]'
      frequency="1m"
      currency="usd"
      amounts="[25, 50, 75]"
      amount="25"
      custom='["amount", "designation"]'
      store="jamstackecommerceexample"
      image="https://picsum.photos/320"
      name="One-Time Donation"

      <div slot="designation">designation</div>
      <div slot="comment">comment</div>
      <div slot="amount">amount</div>
    </foxy-donation>
  `}
>
  <Story
    name="Slots"
    args={{
      designations: ['Medical Care', 'Daily Meals', 'Housing'],
      designation: "Housing",
      frequencies: [' ', '.5m', '1m', '1y'],
      frequency: '1m',
      anonymity: true,
      anonymous: true,
      amounts: [25, 50, 75],
      comment: '',
      custom: ['amount', 'designation'],
      image: 'https://picsum.photos/320',
      url: 'https://foxy.io',
    }}
  >
    {args =>
      html`${getTemplate(
        args,
        html`
          <code slot="designation" class="slot-content">designations</code>
          <code slot="comment" class="slot-content">comment</code>
          <code slot="amount" class="slot-content">amount</code>
        `
      )}`
    }
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Additional Cart Parameters

### Adding the donation to the cart

By default the upon submission user is redirected directly to the checkout.
This is controlled by the `cart` attribute. Set it to `add` to make the form merely add the donation to the cart.

[Please, refer to the documentation for more details](https://wiki.foxycart.com/v/2.0/cheat_sheet#transaction_non-product_specific_options).

### Clearing other items in the cart

The `empty` attribute can be set to 'true' to clear any contents in the cart before adding the donation.

[Please, refer to the documentation for more details](https://wiki.foxycart.com/v/2.0/cheat_sheet#transaction_non-product_specific_options).

## API Reference

<ArgsTable of="foxy-donation" />

## Theming

Our elements are built with Vaadin Lumo theme and therefore share the list of CSS Custom Properties with it. You can find the latest documentation and theme editor on [demo.vaadin.com](https://demo.vaadin.com/lumo-editor/).

## Troubleshooting

### Target

Donation uses the `_top` target by default. This approach avoids issues related to the usage of the custome element within `<iframe>`.

The `target` attribute is responsible for setting the destination window for the forms response.
Donation form uses a native form element to submit and provides it with its own `target` attribute.

You may set a value for `target` to change the default behaviour, which is oppening the cart or checkout page top window.

Example: to display the checkout or the cart in the same frame as the form was, use:

```html
<foxy-donation
  store="jamstackecommerceexample"
  currency="usd"
  amount="25"
  image="https://picsum.photos/320"
  name="One-Time Donation"
  target="_self"
>
</foxy-donation>
```
