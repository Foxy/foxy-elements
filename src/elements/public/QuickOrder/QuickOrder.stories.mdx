# Quick Order

Quick Order Form allows users to place an order based on a list of products.

Users can customize the order editing the product list and the subscription
settings.

You may feed the products to the Form using either the products parameter or
using the custom tag `product-item`.

## Using custom tag for the product

By adding `foxy-items` to your `foxy-order-form` your products will be properly
added to the order. The form will find the products and create the necessary
fields.

You can use any markup you wish. You may place your products in cards, lists,
articles sections and even tables, if that's what you like. Foxy-order-form will
find your products (unless they are in the shadow dom of other elements).

## Using an array of products

You may use an array of product objects to feed the form.
In this scenario you loose a lot of the flexibility, for the product tags will
be created for you one next to the other. You can still customize their look and
feel, but you won't be able to build your markup as you wish.
