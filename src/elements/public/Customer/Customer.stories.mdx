# Customer

[![hAPI](https://img.shields.io/badge/hAPI-customer-green.svg)](https://api.foxycart.com/rels/customer)

The `<foxy-customer>` element is a **relation element** that provides a visual interface for interacting with the `customer` hAPI relation.

## Setup

All relation elements need an `href` attribute to know where to load their content from and a request handler to connect to the backend. You can check if your component is configured properly by running your project and looking for the error message like below â€“ if it isn't there, then you're good to go.
