# I18n

<Subtitle>Custom element for effortless localization with i18next</Subtitle>

## Features

I18n element interface mirrors the [translation function](https://www.i18next.com/translation-function/essentials#overview-options) of i18next: `key` for accessing keys, `options` for providing context, count, default value and more, and 2 additional attributes/properties for ease of use: `ns` for namespaces and `lang` for language. It can do everything an i18next instance can and more:

1. Load JSON translations on demand;
2. Add, edit or remove translations at any time;
3. Easily format dates and prices;
4. Fake translations in tests using `fetch` events.

## Tutorial

Fisrt, let's add `<foxy-i18n>` element to our page and define it in the global registry. You can do it by linking a pre-built library or importing `I18n` class from `@foxy.io/elements` and registering it yourself – the setup instructions are the same for all Foxy Elements (see overview article). By default, I18n element will render nothing:

<Canvas mdxSource="<foxy-i18n></foxy-i18n>" isExpanded>
  <Story name="Default">{() => html`<foxy-i18n></foxy-i18n>`}</Story>
</Canvas>

Let's tell our element which language string we need. We can do that by setting the `key` attribute or property:

<Canvas mdxSource='<foxy-i18n key="foo"></foxy-i18n>' isExpanded>
  <Story name="Missing key">{() => html`<foxy-i18n key="foo"></foxy-i18n>`}</Story>
</Canvas>

Because we haven't got any translations yet, the element will render key as-is. We can add some using the `i18next` instance methods exposed as static property on `I18n` class:

```ts
customElements
  .get('foxy-i18n')
  .i18next.addResource('en', 'shared', 'foo', 'Same foo, but in English');
```

Since `shared` and `en` are set as both default and fallback values for namespace and language respectively, our element should now resolve "foo" key to the provided value and render "Same foo, but in English" instead (check out [this i18next guide](https://www.i18next.com/how-to/add-or-load-translations#add-after-init) for more options). Each localizable element from this package has its own namespace that you can add your translations to.

Still, while having a JS interface can be very useful at times, it's often more practical to write translations in JSON files and store them separately – for example, every element in this Storybook operates exactly that way. I18n element comes with a backend plugin that allows us to load translation files from a custom location on demand. All we need to do is to tell it where to get them from by intercepting the `fetch` events:

```ts
addEventListener('fetch', (event: Event) => {
  if (event instanceof customElements.get('foxy-i18n').FetchEvent) {
    if (event.request.url.startsWith('foxy://i18n')) {
      const [lang, ns] = event.request.url.split('/').reverse();

      event.preventDefault();
      event.respondWith(fetch(`/translations/${ns}/${lang}.json`));
    }
  }
});
```

Whenever I18n element needs to load translations for a language or a namespace, it dispatches the `fetch` event on `window`, requesting a resource at a special URL formatted as `foxy://i18n/NAMESPACE/LANGUAGE` (e.g. `foxy://i18n/shared/en`). We can then rewrite that URL, use mock data or get translations from a local cache if we like. Once loaded, i18next will make those translations avaialable to every `<foxy-i18n>` element on the page. Let's render something from the shared i18n file that comes with Foxy Elements:

<Canvas mdxSource='<foxy-i18n key="demo_key"></foxy-i18n>' isExpanded>
  <Story name="With key">{() => html`<foxy-i18n key="demo_key"></foxy-i18n>`}</Story>
</Canvas>

Cool! Let's see what it looks like in Spanish by setting the [lang attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang):

<Canvas mdxSource='<foxy-i18n key="demo_key" lang="es"></foxy-i18n>' isExpanded>
  <Story name="With lang">{() => html`<foxy-i18n key="demo_key" lang="es"></foxy-i18n>`}</Story>
</Canvas>

How about some country names? We don't always need them, so placing them in the main translation file is a bit uneffective. A separate namespace works much better for such use cases:

<Canvas mdxSource='<foxy-i18n key="GB" ns="country"></foxy-i18n>' isExpanded>
  <Story name="With ns">{() => html`<foxy-i18n key="GB" ns="country"></foxy-i18n>`}</Story>
</Canvas>

You can specify paths to get nested values. In the example below, `foxy-i18n` will load a corresponding file for the `demo` namespace and will look for a nested value at this path: `one.two.three`.

```html
<foxy-i18n key="one.two.three" ns="demo"></foxy-i18n>
```

You can also specify multiple namespaces to look for a key in each one of them. In the example below, `foxy-i18n` will load files for namespaces `one`, `two`, `three` and `shared`. Then, it will look for the value of `two.three.demo` in namespace called `one`, value of `three.demo` in namespace `two` and value of `demo` in namespaces `three` and `shared`. The first value found will be displayed.

```html
<foxy-i18n key="demo" ns="one two three"></foxy-i18n>
```

This is useful when building customizable forms with nested controls because developers can override the translations at any level. For situations when you're overriding the translations only at the top level, you can skip loading extra namespaces by setting the `simplify-ns-loading` attribute:

```html
<foxy-i18n key="demo" ns="one two three" simplify-ns-loading></foxy-i18n>
```

The example above will load only `one` and `shared` namespaces. Then it will look for the value of `two.three.demo` in namespace called `one` and the value of `demo` in `shared`.

To make things even easier when building complex forms, use the `infer` attribute on nested `foxy-i18n` elements and elements with `TranslatableMixin`. This will automatically infer the language, namespace and loading settings from the closest parent element:

```html
<my-translatable-form lang="en" ns="foo bar" simplify-ns-loading>
  <foxy-i18n infer="" key="demo"></foxy-i18n>
</my-translatable-form>
```

In the example above `foxy-i18n` will load namespaces `foo` and `shared`. Then it will look for the value of `bar.demo` in `foo` and the value of `demo` in `shared`, displaying the one it encounters first. You can add namespaces to the `infer` attribute for more nesting:

```html
<my-translatable-form lang="en" ns="foo bar" simplify-ns-loading>
  <foxy-i18n infer="baz" key="demo"></foxy-i18n>
</my-translatable-form>
```

In this example `foxy-i18n` will look for the value of `baz.bar.demo` in `foo`. If we omit `simplify-ns-loading` attribute on the form, `foxy-i18n` will download the translation file for `baz` as well.

Finally, let's pass some [options](https://www.i18next.com/translation-function/essentials#overview-options) to our I18n element. For example, to display a date:

<Canvas
  mdxSource={`<foxy-i18n key="demo_date" options='{"value":"2021-03-14"}'></foxy-i18n>`}
  isExpanded
>
  <Story name="With options">
    {() => html`<foxy-i18n key="demo_date" options='{"value":"2021-03-14"}'></foxy-i18n>`}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
